Personal Website, made entirely with virtual development environments, primarily github codespaces.

Todos:
- Check mobile responsiveness
- Add more cards: songs i've made, development projects
- on live, with debug off, need to get CSS working well (just social boxes are affected.. or I could just put CSS in html). like its with the django migrations that I need to do.
